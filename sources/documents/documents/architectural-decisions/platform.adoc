== Platform

The chosen platform has a fundamental impact on the resulting application as well as on the user experience: Where is it used, from whom and from which device.

=== Considered Options

* Client Application with Command Line Interface
* Client Application with Graphical User Interface
* Web application

=== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Web Application because it can easily be installed, updated and provides maximal user acceptance. The development team has experience in writing web applications meaning they know common pitfalls and limitations of the platform. Command line users might use the already existing proof of concept instead.

=== Pros and Cons of the Options 

==== Client Application with Command Line Interface

* Good, because cross-platform support can be achieved relatively easy (depending on the chosen language/runtime).
* Good, because the development team has experience writing command line applications.
* Good, because all OS-functionality is available.
* Good, because command line tools are relatively simple to implement.
* Bad, because additional runtimes might be required (python, JVM, .NET etc.).
* Bad, because not all users appreciate command line tools.
* Bad, because cross-platform testing is expensive.
* Bad, because mobile devices (phones, tablets, chromebooks) are not supported.
* Bad, because updates must be performed on every client.
* Bad, because additional rights are required for setup.


==== Client Application with Graphical User Interface

* Good, because graphical interfaces have a broad acceptance.
* Good, because all OS-functionality is available.
* Bad, because additional runtimes might be required (python, JVM, .NET etc.).
* Bad, because additional libraries are required (e.g. QT).
* Bad, because cross-platform testing is expensive.
* Bad, because mobile-devices (phones, tablets, chromebooks) are not supported.
* Bad, because updates must be performed on every client.
* Bad, because additional rights are required for setup.
* Bad, because the development team has no experience writing graphical user interfaces.

==== Web Application

* Good, because graphical interfaces have a broad acceptance.
* Good, because the development team has experience writing command line applications.
* Good, because no additional runtime on the client side (except the browser) is required.
* Good, because no additional rights are required for setup.
* Good, because updates must only be performed on the server side (clients need no updates but the platform, i.e. the browser).
* Good, because it scales well.
* Bad, because only limited OS-functionality is available.
* Bad, because testing of multiple browsers and browser versions is expensive.
* Bad, because the supported features vary significantly depending on the browser and version.
* Bad, because a backend server is required although its importance might vary on the chosen architecture.
* Bad, because it has a potentially large attack vector depending on how and where it is deployed.
