== Frontend Framework

To create a user interface for the web application frontend, we must utilise a framework. User Interfaces are too complex these days to implement them in pure JavaScript.

The frontend framework fundamentally restricts the set of implementation languages and has a profound impact on the web interface architecture.

The following aspects must be taken into account to find the most suitable architecture style:

* The effort to learn and master the frameworks best practices must be reasonable.
* The framework must be scalable because the web application is not trivial.
* The number of third party libraries must be kept to a minimum to prevent cost-intense maintenance work in the future.


=== Considered Options

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application[SPA] with Angular5
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application[SPA] with React
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application[SPA] with Vue.js
* Django App

=== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Angular because it comes with batteries included and we, therefore, must not rely on additional third-party libraries for everyday tasks.
Because Angular is opinionated, there is a clear way to do things which will help us to structure the application.
For these benefits, we are willing to accept a steeper learning curve.

=== Pros and Cons of the Options

==== SPA mit Angular5

* Good, because it scales well.
* Good, because the performance is automatically optimised for production builds.
* Good, because it comes with all tools required for building and structuring a sophisticated SPA: components, modules, dependency injection and more.
* Good, because it is very popular, especially in (modern) enterprise applications.
* Good, because it has a large community and is built by Google.
* Good, because it is opinionated, there is a clear way to do things.
* Good, because it uses TypeScript that brings additional safety.
* Bad, because it is heavyweight and hard to learn/understand.
* Bad, because API migrations in the past were costly and hard.
* Bad, because it uses TypeScript which brings indirections and cannot be eliminated.
* Neutral: It is a tool for everything and cannot be used partially.

==== SPA mit React

* Good, because it scales well.
* Good, because it is lightweight.
* Good, because it encourages functional programming and discourages state.
* Good, because it provides components.
* Good, because it uses modern JavaScript features (ES6).
* Good, because it has a large community and is built by Facebook.
* Bad, because its "lightweightness" leads to lots of third-party dependencies.
* Bad, because it is not trivial to learn (e.g. "pseudo" inline HTML requires custom attributes `className`).
* Bad, because it only defines a minimal core and many standard problems must be solved manually.
* Bad, because additional libraries such as Redux must be used and understood to create complex applications.
* Neutral: Uses JS for everything which is a matter of taste.
* Neutral: Can be used partially.

==== SPA mit Vue.js

* Good, because it scales well.
* Good, because it is lightweight.
* Good, because it provides components.
* Good, because it makes no assumptions about the JavaScript version used.
* Good, because it elegantly separates template (HTML), styling (CSS) and logic (JS).
* Good, because the core team also maintains fundamental additional such as routing and state management.
* Good, because it has a large and active community.
* Bad, because its "lightweightness" leads to lots of third-party dependencies.
* Bad, because it only defines a relatively small core and some standard problems must be solved manually.
* Bad, because there is no standard way for non-trivial setups (complex SPA, automated testing, etc.).
* Bad, because additional libraries such as Vuex must be used and understood to create complex applications.
* Neutral: Can be used partially.

==== Django App

* Good, because Django has excellent documentation.
* Good, because Django has a (mostly) stable API.
* Good, because Django is used in other projects in the https://www.ins.hsr.ch/[INS].
* Good, because Django has a very active community.
* Bad, because multiple languages (Python and JavaScript) are required in the frontend.
* Bad, complex client logic (e.g. paging) must still be implemented in JavaScript and might require an additional framework.
* Bad, because it is very heavyweight (includes ORM, migrations and much more) with lots of features that we do not need.
* Bad, because it requires a backend instance in comparison to the SPAs.
