== SASL Authentication Strategy

User Story: 1.2 Authentication: Secure XMPP Connection

The https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mile-xmpp-grid-05#section-8.3.1[XMPP-Grid standard] states in section 8.3.1 that
____
The XMPP-Grid controller MUST authenticate the XMPP-Grid platform either using the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism or using the SASL SCRAM mechanism (with the SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS variant being preferred over the SCRAM-SHA-256 variant and SHA-256 variants [RFC7677] being preferred over SHA-1 varients [RFC5802]).
____

The chosen authentication mechanism has an impact on the implementation of the broker application as well as on the XMPP server support.

Note that this architectural decision has no impact on the communication between the controller and other platforms (i.e. other XMPP clients and the XMPP server).


=== Considered Options

* SASL SCRAM
** SASL SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS is described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677[RFC 7677].
** In summary, SASL SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS means XMPP over TLS with the client authenticating using a username (JID) and password with challenge-response-exchange.
** In our case, we may assume that SASL SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS is currently the only variant supporting a strong hash mechanism 
* SASL EXTERNAL
** SASL EXTERNAL is described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4422#appendix-A[RFC 4422 Appendix A].
** The SASL EXTERNAL mechanism for XMPP in combination with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280[TLS/PKIX] certificates is described in https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0178.html[XEP-0178].
** In our case, we may assume SASL EXTERNAL means XMPP over TLS with the client authenticating using an X.509 certificate, as this is currently the only practical available implementation.

=== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: SASL EXTERNAL, because it offers the highest security level and is well suited for large-scale deployments.

=== Pros and Cons of the Options

==== SASL SCRAM

* Good, because SASL SCRAM is widely supported and used by XMPP servers.
* Good, because SASL SCRAM is easy to use for small deployments, as it only requires a JID and password for authentication.
* Good, because SASL SCRAM fulfils the XMPP-Grid standard requirements.
* Bad, because the key management is on the XMPP controller, which leads to a single point of failure and might lead to additional administration efforts.
* Bad, because shared keys (i.e. the password) are used, which cannot be limited to a validity date or selectively revoked.
* Bad, because shared keys(i.e. the password) are difficult to manage in a large scale, decentralised and automated infrastructure.

==== SASL EXTERNAL

* Good, because a very high-security level can be achieved with X.509 certificates.
* Good, because certificates can be integrated efficiently in a large scale, (mostly) decentralised and automated infrastructure.
* Good, because SASL SCRAM fulfils the XMPP-Grid standard requirements.
* Bad, because a Certification Authority (CA) must be used to issue certificates, which may lead to additional administration efforts and complexity, especially for small deployments.
* Bad, because not all XMPP server and clients have comprehensive support for SASL EXTERNAL.
** Openfire does not support SASL EXTERNAL with WebSockets, however, it is supported with BOSH.
** Ejabberd only supports SASL EXTERNAL in the paid professional edition.
