== Web Application Communication Topology

As we decided to build a web application, it remains open how the communication the backing XMPP server flows.

=== Considered Options

* *XMPP from the Browser with WebSockets (RFC 7395)* +
Directly speak XMPP over a WebSocket connection with the XMPP server.
* *XMPP from the Browser with BOSH (XEP-0206)* +
Directly speak XMPP over an HTTP long polling connection with the XMPP server.
* *XMPP via WebAPI Proxy* +
Create a standalone application that proxies the XMPP server and exposes a web-API to the client (e.g. a RESTful API).

=== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: XMPP from the Browser with WebSockets to reduce duplicated code and use standardised XMPP features.
In case the required features are not implemented, a fallback to BOSH should be possible.

In comparison to XMPP via WebAPI Proxy, WebSockets simplify the deployment of new features because they must not be added in two places (the UI and the WebAPI). In comparison to BOSH, WebSockets offer a stateful TCP-connection based on relatively modern standards while BOSH support is provided by many frameworks as a fallback option.

=== Pros and Cons of the Options

====  XMPP from the Browser with WebSockets (RFC 7395)

* Good, because when building an SPA-Client, it is sufficient to serve just static files which provides a higher level of security and performance.
* Good, because actively maintained clients exists (e.g. Stanza.io). Some libraries also support fallback to BOSH.
* Good, because existing client-certificates can be re-used.
* Good, because existing XMPP-mechanisms are used.
* Bad, because additional server plugins must be enabled which is an additional attack vector. (Workaround: Implement a custom proxy)
* Bad, because it is not a standard yet (Proposed Standard).
* Bad, because SASL EXTERNAL is not well supported with WebSockets
** Openfire does not implement SASL EXTERNAL with WebSockets.
** WebSockets connections over authenticated TLS is not extensively specified, support may therefore vary depending on the browser implementation.
* Bad, because it might lead to security issues (i.e. CSRF) if used in combination with SASL EXTERNAL/TLS, if no strict request-origin verification is done by the server implementation.


====  XMPP from the Browser with BOSH (XEP-0206)

* Good, because when building an SPA-Client, it is sufficient to serve just static files which provide higher levels of security and performance.
* Good, because actively maintained clients exists (e.g. strophe.js).
* Good, because existing client-certificates can be re-used.
* Good, because existing XMPP-mechanisms are used.
* Bad, because additional server plugins must be enabled which is an additional attack vector. (Workaround: Implement a custom proxy)
* Bad, because it is not a standard yet (Draft).
* Bad, because not all HTTP-features might be implemented by the XMPP server, which might be a security risk.
** OPTION preflight requests are not supported by Openfire.
** A reverse HTTP proxy might be used, to support additional HTTP security features.


==== XMPP via WebAPI Proxy

* Good, because it decouples the client from the effective XMPP calls (separation of concerns).
* Good, because only minimal HTTP and JavaScript features are used leading to a broad compatibility.
* Bad, because the indirection can limit the performance significantly.
* Bad, because a server application must be installed and maintained (security updates).
* Bad, because existing XMPP-mechanisms are not used.
