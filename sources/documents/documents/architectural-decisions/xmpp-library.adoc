== XMPP Client Library

To communicate via XMPP from the client via Websockets or Bosh an existing client library shall be used to benefit from an existing implementation.

Primarily, the following aspects are relevant for the decision, ordered by priority:

. Community Support: How well is the project maintained
. Plugin API: Is it easy to create or replace existing plugins
. TypeScript binding: Are there existing TypeScript bindings?

=== Considered Options

* Stanza.io
* strophe.js

=== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: stanza.io, because it offers solid community support and provides a clean plugin API with minimal dependencies.
Although strophe.js has a more active community, some plugins have dependencies on jQuery and are implemented in CoffeeScript.
That is the main reason why we selected Stanza.io over strophe.js.

To fully benefit from TypeScript, we could implement the TypeScript bindings. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html[]
