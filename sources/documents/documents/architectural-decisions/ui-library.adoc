== UI Library

To create a modern and aesthetically pleasing cross-browser user experience and to reduce the implementation efforts, a UI-library shall be used.

=== Considered Options

* https://material.angular.io/[Angular Material]: Material Design components for Angular
* https://edcarroll.github.io/[Semantic UI Angular 2]
* https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/[Spectre.css] with custom components

=== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Spectre.css with custom components, because it has minimal third-party dependencies.

Positive consequences:

* From a security point of view, a pure CSS library does not require updates.
** An Angular component library might introduce security vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS).
** If the CSS library project is discontinued, the XMPP-Grid broker can continue to use the latest available version.

Negative consequences:

* Additional effort is required for creating and testing new components.
* Angulars component features such as style scoping are not fully utilised.
