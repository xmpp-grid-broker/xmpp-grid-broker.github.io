== Writing Guidelines

In order to have a consistent style of writing, we defined the following guidelines. These guidelines apply to all documents related to the redbackup project.

* Keep it brief, clear and objective
* Write short and straightforward sentences
* Do not use synonyms for concepts etc. (always use the same wording, e.g. 'client' or 'node')
* Abbreviations must be introduced the first time they occur in the text (except well-known ones)
* Prevent ambiguity in sentences
* Use personal style ("we") whenever appropriate; usually for the description of our work.
* When a gender-specific pronoun is required, use "he/she".
* Use present tense except for the description of (our) completed work.

== Definition of Done

To maintain our high quality needs, we determined following definition of done guidelines:

* All functionality conforms to the specification. Any deviations must be discussed and decided by the team.
* A review is performed and accepted in a pull request.
** The source code is reasonably documented.
** No code is commented out.
** No warnings and errors by the compiler or any other quality tool.
** Reasonable unit and integration tests exist and pass.
** All documentations are up to date including the project website.
** The complete continuous integration pipeline works.
** The code is formatted according to the guidlines (i.e. according to RustFmt)
* The corresponding branch is merged into the stable branch (e.g. master).
* All time is logged.
