=== Discussions / Decisions

. Discuss Requirements / Wireframes
    * We will send SFF the updated wireframes and requirements.
    * Next week, SFF will accept/reject the current state as the target set of requirements for the thesis.
    * SFF considers the current wireframes as good.
. Architectural Decisions
    * Architectural Decisions Template
    ** SFF appreciates the current format.
    ** We must give more context for non-experts (e.g. what is an XMPP-Bot?).
    * Architectural Decision: Roles
    ** We discussed the pros and cons as described in the Architectural Decision.
    ** The biggest downside is the limited Openfire support as well as the deferred state of XEP-0248.
    ** SFF ratifies this solution.
    * Architectural Decision: XMPP over Websockets/BOSH/Backend
    ** SFF says, that this is an interesting approach to experiment with.
    ** We must conduct experiments to ensure that all functionality indeed works as expected.
    ** SFF says, that from a security aspect, a new interface is not that bad as long as it uses secure authentication mechanisms such as TLS.
    ** If we decide to use WebSockets/BOSH, we should investigate how an adapter could be implemented.
    * Architectural Decision: Client Framework (e.g. React, Vue, Angular)
    ** For SFF, the most important criteria is to not rely on too many third-party dependencies.
    ** Otherwise, we should use the best tool for the task.
    ** The institute has not preferred framework.
. Current State of the Task Description
    * Will be finished until the next meeting, based on our revised requirements.
    * SFF will send the current draft.
. Date and time for the next meeting
    * No weekly meeting on 2018-03-19
    * Next weekly meeting is on 2018-03-23 10:00
