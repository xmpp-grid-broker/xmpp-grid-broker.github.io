=== Discussions / Decisions

. Review Test-Drive
    * SFF noted the following issues:
    ** The application is slow in SFFs setup, which might be improved by modifying the TLS options (`proxy_ssl_session_reuse` and `proxy_request_buffering`). Issue: https://project.redbackup.org/browse/XGB-217[XGB-217].
    ** Timeouts occur even if manually configuring a bigger value. Issue: https://project.redbackup.org/browse/XGB-216[XGB-216].
    ** The page size is too small and should be configurable or at least 50 elements. https://project.redbackup.org/browse/XGB-217[XGB-217].
    ** The error message when returning 403 can be improved ("connection lost").
    *** As discussed, this can be fixed properly by configuring nginx differently.
. Project state
    * We added a new installation guide.
    * We wrote more documentation.
    ** We will send a draft on Thursday to SFF for review.
    * We will address the issues from the test drive.
    * We will extend the e2e tests if we have enough time.
. Discuss Abstract
    * SFF suggests extending the implementation section.
    ** Discuss Architecture in one paragraph and the functionality in another one.
    ** clarify that it's a 100% web-based application that (usually) requires a proxy.
    ** Try to "sell" the project.
    ** Can be longer.
    ** The target audience has generic software know-how (e.g. knows what JS is) but has no expertise in XMPP.
    * SFF says, that the management summary is not necessary.
. Date and time for the next meeting
    * Will be arranged at short notice if needed.
