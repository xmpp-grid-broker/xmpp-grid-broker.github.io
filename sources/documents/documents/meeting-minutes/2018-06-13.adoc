. Signing of the usage rights
    * SFF signed the usage rights.
. Abstract status
    * SFF accepted and forwarded our abstract to the administration.
. Review of the final submission document draft
    * SFF notes that he would have prefered parts of the appendix (eg. architectural decisions) in the main content.
    * The IODEF parts are not 100% accurate anymore and can safely be removed.
. Electronic submission
    * According to SFF, it is sufficient to upload the artifacts via the official tools.
. Project transfer
    * We will install SFF as organisation administrator on our GitHub repository.
    * Further steps can be arranged bilaterally.
