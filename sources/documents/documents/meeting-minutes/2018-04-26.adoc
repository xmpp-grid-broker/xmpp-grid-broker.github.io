    * To use an existing XMPP server, we recommend using the development setup with another upstream XMPP server

    ** The upstream URL must be replaced
    * We will publish an alpha release this week

    * SFF will clarify if this date works for the other groups and the expert as well.
. Review: Issues we encountered
    * We were missing some functionality in the XMPP standards
    ** loading all available configuration options before the creation of a topic
    ** Lost updates when updating the topic configuration (eg. `max-items` and `node_type`)
    * We decided to only focus on the features as Openfire support it
