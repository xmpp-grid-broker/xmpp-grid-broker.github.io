=== Discussions / Decisions

. Discuss Requirements / Wireframes
    * SFF accepts the current state of the wireframes.
. Current State of the Task Description
    * We collectively declared the Task Description final.
    * SFF suggests to move it up in the document before the abstract (https://project.redbackup.org/browse/XGB-105[XGB-105]).
. The current state of co-examinator
    * Prof. Dr Thomas Bocek is the co-examinator of this thesis.
    * We will organise the interim presentation in 2-5 weeks from now, ideally combined with a weekly meeting and not on Tuesdays.
. "Broker" Term
    * While reading the XMPP-Grid IETF draft, we were confused by the definition of "Broker", and whether it applies to our application.
    * SFF sees no discrepancy. We might not implement the complete broker but at least parts of it.
. Architectural security analysis with an industry expert (https://project.redbackup.org/browse/XGB-97[XGB-97])
    * SFF suggests conducting the security analysis with Tobias Brunner on a Monday.
. Date and time for the next meeting

    * No weekly meeting on 2018-04-02 (Easter Monday)
    * Next weekly meeting on 2018-04-09
