\chapter{Project Overview}
The goal of the bachelor thesis is to build a broker application and graphical user interface to administer XMPP-Grids according to draft-ietf-mile-xmpp-grid, as described in the task description \cite{task-description}.


\chapter{Project Organisation}
All team members have the same strategic rights and duties. Prof. Dr. Andreas Steffen is our project advisor.

\section{Roles}
Due to the small team size, most roles are performed by both team members.

\chapter{Project Management}
\section{Components}
For a better overview and to allow us a sophisticated time assessment, we decided to group tasks into categories, i.e. JIRA components. Components represent processes, documents and products which are to be released.

Currently, tasks are separated into following components:

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Application
        \item Final Submission Document
        \item Management
        \item Poster
        \item Presentation
        \item Project Plan
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\section{Time Budget}
The project started with the Kickoff Meeting on 19.02.2018 and will be completed after 16 weeks by 15.06.2018.
The two team members are available for 360 hours each during the semester which corresponds to a weekly time budget of 20 hours per person and two weeks with a weekly time budget of 40 hours per person.

Apart from the statutory holidays, there are no further absences planned.

\section{Schedule}
The project schedule is an iterative process based on elements of SCRUM.

We decided on a sprint duration of approximately one week, but allow deviations in working hours depending on statutory holidays.

\subsection{Iterations \& Milestones}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Meetings}
The team works every Monday (08:00 - 12:00) and Tuesday (08:00 - 17:00) together in the study room and remotely Fridays (08:00 - 17:00). Wednesday and Friday begin with a daily stand-up meeting taking no longer than 15 minutes. Sprint planning meetings are carried out on Tuesday at 10:00. Table \ref{meeting-time-budget} shows an overview of the total meeting time budget.

\begin{table}[]

        \textbf{Standup Meetings}         & 16 hours                            & 32 hours                             \\
        \textbf{Sprint Planning Meetings} & 18 hours                           & 36 hours                             \\
        \textbf{Retrospective}            & 4 hours                            & 8 hours                              \\ \hline
        \textbf{Total}                    & 50 hours                           & 100 hours
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Regular meetings with the project advisor usually take place on Monday in Prof. Dr. Steffen's office.

Raphael Zimmermann will take meeting notes for every meeting. Meeting minutes are published as appendix of the thesis afterwards.

\chapter{Risk Management}
An assessment of the project-specific risks is carried out in Table \ref{tbl:project-risks} as time loss during the whole project. The risk matrix in Table \ref{tbl:risk-matrix} provides an overview of the risk weighting.

To account for these risks, we reduce our weekly sprint time by the total weighted risk applicable to the planned task topics (on average approximately 13.5\%). We also review the risk assessment after every sprint, adapt it and take measures if necessary.

\chapter{Infrastructure}
\section{Project Management and Development}
For project management we utilise JIRA~\cite{atlassian-opensource}, hosted on our HSR project server, which runs a standard Ubuntu Linux 17.10.

As document/code storage, git repositories on GitHub are used, the continuous integration/deployment will be defined in the course of the project.

\subsection{Development Tools}
The development tools will be defined in the course of the project.

\section{Backup and Data Safety}
An incremental backup of the project server including the source code and documentation is created on an independent system every night.

As our documents and code is stored in a git repository, they are also distributed on all development systems.


\chapter{Quality Measures}
To maintain a high standard of quality, we take the following measures:

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item short sprint reviews
        \item four extended retrospectives
        \item code reviews
        \item automated unit and integration testing
        \item publish all documentation on the project website using continuous integration/delivery.
        \item using continuous integration for source code
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\section{Documentation}
The official documents such as the final submission document, meeting minutes as well as this project plan are written in \LaTeX~respectively ASCIIDoc and published on the project website\footnote{\url{https://xgb.redbackup.org}} containing all PDF documents.

The sources are in both cases kept under version control in the same repository, which allows us to use the same tools and processes for documentation and code. The continuous integration server builds and publishes the website whenever new changes are pushed to the repository.

\section{Project Management}
Because the project plan allows for an iterative process, we use JIRA with its SCRUM-features (such as sprint creation or boards) for project management.

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
Each sprint is mapped to JIRA, which allows the project advisor to trace the project progress. Sprints are represented as boards on which the current state and assignee of any issue is easily visible ("To Do", "In Progress", "Review", "Done").


\subsection{Definition of Done}
An issue may be closed if \emph{all} of the following conditions are met:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All functionality conforms to the specification. Any deviations must be discussed and decided by the team.
    \item The source code is reasonably documented.
    \item No code is commented out.
    \item No warnings and errors by the compiler or any other quality tool.
    \item A review is performed and accepted in a pull request.
    \item The corresponding branch is merged into the stable branch (e.g. master).
    \item All documents are up to date including the project website.
    \item Reasonable unit and integration tests exist and pass.
    \item The complete continuous integration pipeline works.
    \item All time is logged.
\end{itemize}

\section{Development}

We decided to use GitHub Flow\cite{github-flow}, a straightforward development workflow.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{resources/github_flow}
    \caption[Organigram]{GitHub Flow illustrated ( Source \cite{github-flow})}
    \label{fig:organigram}
\end{figure}


Since the effective technology will be fixed later in the project, concrete coding guidelines, tools, metrics and an error policy will be defined when appropriate.


\section{Testing}
All functionality must be automatically testable using continuous integration. Any non-trivial function/method must be verified with unit tests.

Integration tests verify extended test scenarios.
