= Tutorial setup with Openfire and nginx
:toc:

This tutorial guides you through the setup of an XMPP-Grid Broker with an Openfire XMPP server and nginx web server.

After this tutorial, your setup will look like the this:

== Requirements

This guide assumes you are using Linux or macOS with the `openssl` binary installed.

Also, we assume you have installed and configured http://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/documentation/install-guide.html[Openfire] and https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/[nginx]. In this tutorial, we use the following hostnames. You can replace the hostnames and ports to suit your needs.

|===
| Application | Hostname

|nginx server |`xgb.localhost.redbackup.org`
|Openfire server |`openfire`
|===

This guide assumes `admin` as Openfire administration user. It will be used by the XMPP-Grid Broker to configure the XMPP server.

== Generate certificates

To get started, we need 3 TLS certificates for the following instances:

* Host `openfire`
* Host `xgb.localhost.redbackup.org`
* Client certificate for the user `admin`
** With the `xmppAddr` set to `admin@openfire` (as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120[RFC 6120])

We will use a custom certification authority (CA) to sign these certificates. For that purpose, you can use a script which generates the custom CA and all required certificates in this repository.

To generate the certificates run following steps:

[source, bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:xmpp-grid-broker/xmpp-grid-broker.git
cd xmpp-grid-broker/stack/certs
rm -r keys # # <1>
./generate.bash
----
<1> This removes all development certificates.

In this tutorial, we refer to this certificate folder as `certs/`.

If you would like to customise the certificate and CA configuration, you can do so by editing the files in `conf`. Note that the script generates additional certificates which are not used in this tutorial.

== Setup Openfire

Go to the Openfire administration interface, in our example setup https://openfire:9091/, and modify configuration as described in the following screenshots.

== Setup nginx

The first step is to copy the certificates from `certs/keys/host`, `certs/keys/client` as well as the CA public key from `certs/keys/ca-fullchain.pem` to the folder `/etc/certs` on your nginx server.

Secondly, add following configuration to your nginx setup, for example in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/xmpp-grid-broker.conf`.

== Setup XMPP-Grid Broker

Add the https://github.com/xmpp-grid-broker/xmpp-grid-broker/releases[latest XMPP-Grid Broker release] on the nginx server in the web root folder under `/var/www/xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/`.

Create the configuration file `configuration.json` also in the web root folder `/var/www/xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/` with the following content:

[source, json]
----
{
  "xmpp": {
    "server":     "openfire",
    "transport":  "bosh",
    "boshURL":    "https://xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/http-bind"
  }
}
----

All configuration options are documented in the link:INSTALL.md#Configuration[expert installation guide].


== That's it!

To finish the XMPP-Grid Broker setup, restart nginx.

Next, add the CA and client certificate from `certs/keys/ca-fullchain.pem` and `certs/keys/client/admin@openfire/admin@openfire.p12` to your browser.  In Firefox, you can do this in the Preferences under `Privacy & Security` -> `View-Certificates` in the tab `Your Certificates` (client certificate) and `Authorities` (CA) respectively.

The XMPP-Grid Broker application is now available under https://xgb.localhost.redbackup.org/.
